# Stickbot

## Description

This is my personal fork of [RTByte](https://github.com/RTByte/rtbyte)--an open-source modular multipurpose Discord bot. It's built using the [Sapphire Framework](https://github.com/sapphiredev/framework) on top of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). RTByte is also heavily based on [skyra](https://github.com/skyra-project/skyra), and as such, so is Stickbot.
